This implementation is a fork of the Palantir Docker Plugin at https://github.com/palantir/gradle-docker
with a reset of the version numbering scheme. The three plugins were combined into one, the Guava dependency was removed,
and it was ensured to build and run under Java 11 and Gradle 5. The package structure and documentation
have been adjusted; references to original authors and versions have been removed
for clarity and consistency.
